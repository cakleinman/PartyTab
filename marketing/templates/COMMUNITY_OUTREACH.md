### Reddit Rules
1. **Never spam** - Reddit will destroy you
2. **Provide value first** - Be helpful before mentioning your product
3. **Be transparent** - If asked, admit you're the creator
4. **Follow subreddit rules** - Some ban self-promotion entirely
5. **Use your personal account** - Don't make a "PartyTab" branded account

### Template 1: Answering "How do you split expenses?"

**Context:** Someone asks how to handle group trip finances

```
For our last ski trip, we tried a few things:

1. One person pays everything and people Venmo them back
   (annoying to track who owes what)

2. Spreadsheet (works but gets messy when 6 people are
   adding stuff and some expenses don't include everyone)

3. Splitwise (fine but felt overcomplicated for what we needed)

We ended up using PartyTab (partytab.app) which worked well -
you just add expenses as they happen and it figures out
who owes who at the end. Free and doesn't need an app download.

Main thing is just pick ONE method and have everyone agree
to it before the trip. The worst is when half the group
thinks you're "even" and the other half has a detailed ledger.
```

### Template 2: Thread About Bachelor Party Planning

**Context:** Someone planning a bachelor party asking for tips

```
Did my buddy's bachelor party last summer, here's what worked:

**Budget stuff:**
- Get the Venmo/payment situation figured out BEFORE you leave.
  We used PartyTab to track everything and it saved so much drama.
- Whoever books the Airbnb/hotel should NOT have to front the
  whole thing. Get deposits from everyone.
- Build in a buffer. Someone always wants to do "one more thing."

**Logistics:**

### Template 3: Responding to "Splitwise Alternatives?"

**Context:** Someone looking for Splitwise alternatives

```
Depends what you didn't like about Splitwise:

- Too complicated? → PartyTab (partytab.app) is way simpler.
  Just "who paid, how much, who was there." Done.

- Want integrated payments? → Venmo/PayPal have their own
  split features now

- Need offline? → Tricount works offline

I switched to PartyTab because I didn't need all the features
Splitwise has and just wanted something dead simple for trips
with friends. YMMV.

## Facebook Groups Strategy

### Target Groups
- Bachelor party planning groups
- Bachelorette party planning groups
- Travel planning communities
- Destination wedding groups
- Roommate/housing groups in major cities
- Ski/beach destination groups

### Approach
1. Join groups and observe for 1-2 weeks
2. Participate genuinely - answer questions, share experiences
3. When expense-splitting comes up naturally, share your experience
4. Never post promotional content unless groups explicitly allow it

### Template: Facebook Group Comment

```
We dealt with this on our last group trip! The spreadsheet
got SO messy by day 3.

What worked for us was using an app called PartyTab - you
just add expenses as they happen (takes like 5 seconds) and
at the end it tells everyone exactly what they owe. Way less
awkward than trying to figure it out from memory later.

The main thing is having SOME system in place before you go.
Doesn't matter what it is as long as everyone agrees to use it!

## Indie Hackers / Startup Communities

### Template: Introduction Post

```
Hey everyone! 👋

I'm [Name], and I recently launched PartyTab - a simple tool
for splitting group expenses.

**The problem:** Every group trip ends the same way - someone
makes a spreadsheet, it gets confusing, and there's awkward
conversations about who owes what.

**The solution:** Add expenses as they happen (who paid, how
much, who was there). We calculate the minimum payments needed
to settle up.

**What makes it different:**
- Simpler than Splitwise (no complexity you don't need)
- Works in browser (no app download required)
- Free

Would love feedback from anyone who's dealt with this problem.
What's been your go-to solution for group expenses?

```

### Template: Comment on Relevant Discussions

```
I actually built something to solve exactly this!

PartyTab (partytab.app) - it's basically "add expense →
who was there → done." At the end, it calculates the
simplest way to settle up.

The key insight was that most expense-splitting apps are
overbuilt. People don't need recurring expenses, IOUs,
or 50 features. They need: "We went on a trip, who owes who?"

Happy to hear what you think if you try it!

## Hacker News (Show HN)

### Title Options
- "Show HN: PartyTab – Simple expense splitting for group trips"
- "Show HN: I built a simpler alternative to Splitwise"

### Post Template

```
Hi HN,

I built PartyTab (https://partytab.app) to solve the "who owes
who after a group trip" problem.

The flow is simple:
1. Create a tab for your trip/event
2. Add expenses as they happen (who paid, how much, who was there)
3. At the end, see exactly who owes who

It calculates the minimum number of payments needed to settle
everything. So instead of 6 people making 15 payments to each
other, it might be 2 people making 1 payment each.

**Why I built it:**
Splitwise felt overcomplicated for casual trips with friends.
Spreadsheets get messy. I wanted something my non-technical
friends would actually use.

**Tech stack:** [if relevant - Next.js, etc.]

Would love feedback, especially on the UX. Does the flow make
sense? What would make you switch from whatever you currently use?

### When Someone Says "This is great!"

```
Thanks so much! 🙏 If you end up using it on a trip, I'd
love to hear how it goes. Always looking to make it better.
```

### When Someone Has Feature Requests

```
Great suggestion! We're definitely thinking about [feature].
Right now we're focused on keeping it super simple, but
this is on our radar. Would you mind if I reached out when
we add something like this?
```

### When Someone Compares to Splitwise

```
Yeah, Splitwise is solid! We're intentionally more minimal -
no account required, no app download, just the core
expense-splitting functionality.

Different tools for different needs. Splitwise is great
if you want all the features. PartyTab is for people who
just want "who owes who" without the complexity.
```
