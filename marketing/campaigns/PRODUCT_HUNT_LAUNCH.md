### First Comment (Maker Comment)
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

We built PartyTab because we were tired of the post-trip payment chaos.

You know the drill: Someone makes a spreadsheet. It gets confusing.
Nobody knows who owes what. And there's always that awkward moment
when you have to ask friends for money.

PartyTab fixes this:
✅ Add expenses as they happen (takes 5 seconds)
✅ Automatically tracks who owes who
✅ Calculates the simplest way to settle up
✅ Works in your browser - no app download needed
✅ Completely free

We've tested this on our own trips - bachelor parties, ski weekends,
beach houses - and it's saved us hours of calculator math and
awkward group chat conversations.

Would love your feedback! What's the worst expense-splitting
experience you've had? 🙈
