      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          You covered the bar tab last weekend. You fronted the Airbnb deposit for the group
          trip. You spotted your friend lunch when they forgot their wallet. And now you&apos;re
          waiting for them to pay you back, but days turn into weeks and it&apos;s getting
          awkward.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Here&apos;s the uncomfortable truth: 40% of Americans have avoided a friend who owes
          them money because bringing it up feels too awkward. You shouldn&apos;t have to be
          the bad guy for asking for your own money back.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          The good news? There&apos;s a right way to handle this. Below are copy-paste text
          templates that strike the perfect balance between polite and direct. But first,
          let&apos;s talk about why this feels so hard.
        </p>

        <h2
          className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-12 mb-4"
          id="why-awkward"
        >
          Why It Feels So Awkward
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Money and friendship occupy two different emotional spaces. Friendship is built on
          trust, generosity, and not keeping score. Money requires accounting, boundaries, and
          follow-through. When they collide, it feels like you&apos;re choosing money over the
          relationship.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          The stats are brutal: 32% of people who lent money to a friend never got it back,
          according to a Bank of America survey. And the longer you wait to ask, the harder it
          gets. After two weeks, most people assume you&apos;ve forgotten or don&apos;t care.
          After a month, bringing it up feels aggressive.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          But here&apos;s what you need to remember: if your friend cares about you, they want
          to pay you back. They probably just forgot, or they&apos;re waiting for payday, or
          they&apos;re equally awkward about bringing it up. A polite reminder isn&apos;t rude.
          It&apos;s honest.
        </p>

          The Golden Rules for Asking for Money Back
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Before we get to the templates, here are five principles that should guide every
          money conversation:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-ink-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Be direct but kind.</strong> Beating around the bush makes it more awkward,
            not less. Say what you need clearly, then move on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Don&apos;t apologize for asking.</strong> You&apos;re not being rude.
            You&apos;re asking for what&apos;s yours. Skip &quot;Sorry to bother you, but…&quot;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Give them the benefit of the doubt.</strong> Assume they forgot, not that
            they&apos;re avoiding you. Your tone should reflect that.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set a deadline.</strong> &quot;Whenever you can&quot; means never. Give a
            specific timeframe like &quot;by this Friday&quot; or &quot;before the end of the
            month.&quot;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Offer alternatives.</strong> If they&apos;re tight on cash, suggest
            Venmo/Zelle (easier than cash), or offer to split it into two payments.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Now, let&apos;s get to the actual messages.
        </p>

        <h2

          id="templates"
        >
          Copy-Paste Text Templates
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Template 1: First Casual Reminder (Right After the Event)
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Send this within 1-3 days. It&apos;s friendly, assumes they remember, and makes it
          easy to pay.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sand-300 pl-4 italic text-ink-600 my-6">
          Hey! Just wanted to send you my Venmo (@yourname) for your half of last
          night&apos;s dinner. It was $42. No rush, but lmk when you send it so I can keep
          track. Thanks!
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> You&apos;re giving them the tools (your Venmo handle)
          and the amount (no guessing), plus a soft deadline (&quot;lmk when you send it&quot;).
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Template 2: Follow-Up After a Week
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          They didn&apos;t respond to the first message. This one is still friendly but a bit
          more direct.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sand-300 pl-4 italic text-ink-600 my-6">
          Hey, following up on the $42 from last week&apos;s dinner. Can you Venmo me by
          Friday? Let me know if you need my info again.
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> You&apos;ve added a deadline (Friday) and
          you&apos;re not asking if they remember—you&apos;re asking when they&apos;ll pay.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Template 3: The &quot;I Need It for a Specific Reason&quot; Approach
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          This works well for larger amounts or when you actually do need the money back soon.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sand-300 pl-4 italic text-ink-600 my-6">
          Hey, I hate to be that person, but I&apos;m covering rent this week and could really
          use the $120 from the Airbnb. Could you send it by Wednesday? Venmo or Zelle works.
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> It gives context without oversharing. You&apos;re not
          being dramatic—you just need your money back for a legitimate reason.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Template 4: The Humor Approach
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          If you have the kind of friendship where humor defuses tension, this one can work
          wonders.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sand-300 pl-4 italic text-ink-600 my-6">
          Your personal banker here 👋 Just a friendly reminder that you owe me $35 from
          trivia night. I accept Venmo, Zelle, or small unmarked bills. Interest-free until
          next Friday 😂
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> The joke softens the ask, but the deadline and payment
          info are still clear. Use this with close friends, not acquaintances.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Template 5: The Direct Approach (For Larger Amounts)
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          When it&apos;s been too long or the amount is significant, drop the softeners.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sand-300 pl-4 italic text-ink-600 my-6">
          Hi [Name], I need to settle up on the $250 I lent you last month. Can you send it
          by the end of this week? Let me know if you need to break it into two payments.
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> No fluff. You&apos;ve stated the amount, the
          deadline, and offered flexibility. If they respond poorly to this, that&apos;s a
          them problem.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Template 6: The Group Trip Follow-Up
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Group expenses are the worst for tracking. This template works when you fronted
          costs for multiple people.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sand-300 pl-4 italic text-ink-600 my-6">
          Hey everyone! Had a blast on the trip. Quick reminder that I covered the Airbnb
          ($180/person) and the boat rental ($65/person). If you haven&apos;t sent your share
          yet, my Venmo is @yourname. Trying to close this out by Monday. Thanks!
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> Group messages create gentle social pressure
          (everyone can see who hasn&apos;t paid), and you&apos;re framing it as
          &quot;closing out&quot; the trip, not chasing people.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Template 7: The Installment Plan Offer
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          If someone is clearly struggling financially but you still need the money back, this
          shows empathy while protecting yourself.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sand-300 pl-4 italic text-ink-600 my-6">
          Hey, I know money&apos;s tight right now, but I do need the $150 back. Would it be
          easier if you sent $50 now and $50 each of the next two weeks? Let me know what
          works.
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> You&apos;re acknowledging their situation without
          letting them off the hook. A payment plan is better than no payment.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Template 8: The Final Follow-Up
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          If you&apos;ve sent multiple reminders and gotten no response, this is your last
          text before you either write it off or escalate.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-sand-300 pl-4 italic text-ink-600 my-6">
          [Name], I&apos;ve asked a few times about the $200 you owe me. I need a response by
          Friday—either payment or a plan to pay. This is important to me, and I&apos;d like
          to resolve it.
        </blockquote>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> It&apos;s firm without being hostile. You&apos;re
          signaling that this is serious, and silence is no longer an acceptable response.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-400 p-4 my-6">
          <p className="text-amber-800 font-medium mb-1">
            💡 Pro Tip: Screenshot the Expense
          </p>
          <p className="text-amber-700 text-sm">
            If you used a shared expense tracker, screenshot the balance and attach it to
            your message. It&apos;s not confrontational—it&apos;s just proof. People are less
            likely to dispute a number when it&apos;s documented.

          What NOT to Say
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Avoid these common mistakes that make things worse, not better:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-ink-700">
          <li>
            <strong>&quot;Sorry to bother you, but…&quot;</strong> You&apos;re not bothering
            anyone. Stop apologizing for asking for your own money.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>&quot;If you get a chance…&quot;</strong> This makes it optional. It&apos;s
            not. They owe you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>&quot;Remember when I paid for…&quot;</strong> Don&apos;t make them guess
            what you&apos;re talking about. State the amount and the date.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Passive-aggressive Venmo requests.</strong> Sending a Venmo charge with no
            context or a snarky note (&quot;For that thing you conveniently forgot&quot;) is
            aggressive, not passive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bringing it up publicly.</strong> Never post on social media or call them
            out in front of other friends. That&apos;s how you lose friendships.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Threatening legal action immediately.</strong> Unless it&apos;s thousands
            of dollars and you have a written agreement, small claims court isn&apos;t worth
            the headache.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          The goal is to get your money back and keep the friendship. Aggressive tactics might
          get you paid, but they&apos;ll cost you the relationship.
        </p>

          The Better Solution: Remove the Awkwardness Entirely
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Here&apos;s the thing: you shouldn&apos;t have to send these texts at all. The
          reason money conversations feel awkward is because you&apos;re putting yourself in
          the position of debt collector. Your friend knows they owe you, but
          there&apos;s no external accountability, so it&apos;s easy to deprioritize.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          The best way to handle this? Use a shared expense tracker that sends automated
          reminders. When the app sends the reminder instead of you, it removes the personal
          tension. It&apos;s not you nagging—it&apos;s just a neutral notification that
          someone owes money.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          This is especially helpful for group trips, recurring dinners, or shared housing
          costs. Everyone can see the running balance in real time, so there&apos;s no
          &quot;I forgot&quot; excuse. And when it&apos;s time to settle up, the app does the
          asking for you.

          Final Thoughts
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          Asking for money back shouldn&apos;t feel like a moral crisis. You covered an
          expense in good faith, and you deserve to be repaid. The right approach is direct,
          polite, and assumes good intentions.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-ink-700 leading-relaxed">
          If someone reacts poorly to a reasonable request, that tells you everything you need
          to know about them. Good friends pay their debts without drama.
