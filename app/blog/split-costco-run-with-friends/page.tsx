          How to Split a Costco Run with Friends
        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-ink-600">
          Costco&apos;s prices are unbeatable — but the quantities are designed
          for families, not single people. Solution: split a Costco run with
          friends or roommates.
        </p>
      </header>

      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p>
          You&apos;re standing in Costco, staring at a 48-pack of toilet paper.
          The per-roll price is incredible — half what you&apos;d pay at a
          regular grocery store. But you live in a 600-square-foot apartment.
          Where are you going to store 48 rolls?
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the Costco paradox: bulk pricing delivers massive savings,
          but bulk quantities are designed for families with garages and pantry
          rooms. If you&apos;re single or living with one roommate, buying in
          bulk often means food goes bad or storage becomes a nightmare.
        </p>

        <p>The fix? Split a Costco run with friends.</p>

        <h2 id="why-group" className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-12 mb-4">
          Why Costco Runs Work Better as a Group
        </h2>

        <p>
          Costco&apos;s bulk pricing is built on volume. The more you buy, the
          lower the per-unit cost. But volume only makes sense if you can
          actually use it all before it expires.
        </p>

        <p>Here&apos;s what you gain by splitting a Costco run:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Per-unit savings of 20-40%</strong> compared to regular
            grocery stores
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No waste:</strong> Split a case of avocados 3 ways instead
            of watching 10 of them rot
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Storage solved:</strong> You take home 12 rolls of paper
            towels, not 48
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access to bulk pricing</strong> without committing to
            restaurant-sized quantities
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shared membership cost:</strong> Split the annual fee among
            regular co-shoppers
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A group Costco run turns bulk shopping from impractical to
          indispensable — especially for staples like toilet paper, paper
          towels, cleaning supplies, and pantry basics.
        </p>

        <h2 id="planning" className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-12 mb-4">
          Before You Go: Plan the Trip
        </h2>

        <p>
          A successful group Costco run starts before you leave the house.
          Here&apos;s how to plan it:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          1. Make a Shared Shopping List
        </h3>

        <p>
          Use a shared Google Doc, group chat, or note. Everyone adds what they
          want. Include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Item name</li>
          <li>Approximate Costco price (look it up online or from past trips)</li>
          <li>Who wants it</li>
          <li>Quantity needed per person</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Example: &quot;Toilet paper, 48-pack, $25 → split 3 ways = 16 rolls
          each, ~$8/person.&quot;
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          2. Mark Items as Shared vs Individual
        </h3>

        <p>
          Some items everyone wants (toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags).
          Others are individual preferences (specific snacks, proteins,
          beverages).
        </p>

        <p>
          Shared items get split evenly among everyone on the trip. Individual
          items get assigned to specific people.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          3. Agree on Quantity Splits
        </h3>

        <p>
          If 3 people want the 48-pack of toilet paper, each person takes 16
          rolls and pays $8.33. If only 2 people want the organic mixed nuts,
          they split the cost and quantity between them.
        </p>

        <p>Write this down before you go. It avoids confusion at checkout.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          4. Choose the Driver (Someone with a Membership)
        </h3>

        <p>
          Costco requires a membership to shop. One person with a membership
          drives and checks out. Everyone else Venmos them later. (Or rotate
          who drives each month if multiple people have memberships.)
        </p>

        <div className="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-400 p-4 my-6">
          <p className="text-amber-800 font-medium mb-1">
            💡 Pro tip: Don&apos;t split perishables among too many people
          </p>
          <p className="text-amber-700 text-sm">
            A case of avocados split 2 ways makes sense — you each get 6-8 and
            can use them within a week. Split 6 ways, you&apos;ve each got 2-3
            avocados going bad before you can eat them. Stick to 2-3 people per
            perishable item.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="at-the-store" className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-12 mb-4">
          At the Store: How to Track
        </h2>

        <p>
          Once you&apos;re at Costco, the goal is simple: grab everything on
          the list and track who&apos;s getting what.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          1. Stick to the List
        </h3>

        <p>
          Costco is designed to make you impulse-buy. Resist. If
          something&apos;s not on the shared list, it&apos;s an individual
          purchase and that person pays for it entirely.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          2. Use Colored Stickers or Marks
        </h3>

        <p>
          Some groups use colored stickers or masking tape to mark items in the
          cart by person. Example: Red sticker = Person A, Blue sticker =
          Person B, No sticker = Shared.
        </p>

        <p>
          This makes dividing the haul easier when you get back to the car or
          someone&apos;s apartment.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          3. Photograph the Receipt Immediately
        </h3>

        <p>
          The second you leave the checkout lane, photograph the receipt. Send
          it to the group chat. This is your source of truth for splitting the
          bill later.
        </p>

        <h2 id="after-trip" className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-12 mb-4">
          After the Trip: Splitting the Bill
        </h2>

        <p>
          You&apos;re back from Costco. The trunk is full. The receipt is
          $247.83. Now what?
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 1: Divide the Haul
        </h3>

        <p>
          Unload everything and physically divide items based on who&apos;s
          taking what. Use your pre-trip quantity splits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Example: The 48-pack of toilet paper gets split into 3 groups of 16
          rolls. Each person takes their share.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 2: Scan the Receipt and Assign Costs
        </h3>

        <p>Go through the receipt line by line and assign each item:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Shared items:</strong> Divide cost evenly among all
            participants
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Individual items:</strong> Assign full cost to the person
            taking it
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Partially shared items:</strong> Divide cost among the 2-3
            people who want it
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Example receipt breakdown (3 people: Alex, Jordan, Casey):
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Toilet paper, $24.99 → Shared among all 3 → $8.33 each</li>
          <li>Paper towels, $19.99 → Shared among all 3 → $6.66 each</li>
          <li>Organic mixed nuts, $15.99 → Alex and Jordan only → $8.00 each</li>
          <li>Rotisserie chicken, $4.99 → Casey only → $4.99</li>
          <li>Trash bags, $18.99 → Shared among all 3 → $6.33 each</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Total owed:</strong> Alex: $22.99, Jordan: $22.99, Casey:
          $26.32
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 3: Settle Up
        </h3>

        <p>
          The driver paid $247.83 upfront. Everyone else Venmos or Zelles their
          share. Done.
        </p>

        <h2 id="membership" className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-12 mb-4">
          The Membership Question
        </h2>

        <p>
          Costco membership costs $65/year (Gold Star) or $130/year (Executive,
          which includes 2% cash back). If you&apos;re doing regular group
          Costco runs, the membership pays for itself fast.
        </p>

        <p>Here&apos;s the math:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            If 3 friends share monthly Costco runs, split the $65 membership =
            $21.67/person/year
          </li>
          <li>
            At 20-40% savings on staples, you break even after spending
            ~$50-100 total at Costco
          </li>
          <li>
            Most households hit that in 1-2 trips (toilet paper, paper towels,
            trash bags, cleaning supplies)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Rotation tip:</strong> If multiple people in your group have
          memberships, rotate who drives and whose card gets used. This spreads
          out the Executive cashback benefits.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Go mid-week, mid-morning:</strong> Avoid weekend crowds.
            Tuesday or Wednesday at 10 AM is ideal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bring reusable bags or boxes:</strong> Costco doesn&apos;t
            provide bags. Bring your own for easier haul division.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check Costco&apos;s online inventory first:</strong> Not
            all items are in stock at all locations. Look up prices and
            availability before you go.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set a monthly cadence:</strong> First Saturday of every
            month, same group. Makes it a habit instead of a logistical
            challenge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bring a cooler for perishables:</strong> If you&apos;re
            buying frozen or refrigerated items, bring a cooler with ice packs
            for the drive home.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Group Costco runs turn bulk shopping from wasteful to
          practical — and they&apos;re kind of fun. You get the savings, skip
          the food waste, and split the membership cost. Just plan ahead, track
          the haul, and settle up quickly.
