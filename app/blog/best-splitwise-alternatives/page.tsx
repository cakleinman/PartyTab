                    Splitwise was the gold standard for group expense splitting—until they introduced daily expense limits, unskippable ads with cooldown timers, and paywalled essential features like search and receipt scanning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The free tier, once genuinely useful, became frustrating enough that users are leaving in droves. Reddit threads and Twitter are full of people asking: &quot;What&apos;s a good Splitwise alternative?&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    This guide covers 7 alternatives we tested, with an honest breakdown of what&apos;s free, what&apos;s paid, and which one might work best for your group.
                </p>

                <h2 id="why-leaving" className="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-12 mb-4">
                    Why People Are Leaving Splitwise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Splitwise built a genuinely great product. But the free tier has degraded significantly:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>3-5 expenses per day limit</strong> on free accounts</li>
                    <li><strong>Unskippable video ads</strong> with a 10-second cooldown between actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Search is now Pro-only</strong> (can&apos;t find old expenses without upgrading)</li>
                    <li><strong>Receipt scanning is Pro-only</strong> (was previously free)</li>
                    <li><strong>Currency conversion is Pro-only</strong> (critical for international trips)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pro costs ~$40/year</strong> (varies by country)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To be clear: Splitwise needs revenue, and building software isn&apos;t free. But the free tier became barely usable for active trips. If you&apos;re on a week-long vacation and can only log 3 expenses per day, you&apos;re either upgrading or switching apps.
                </p>

                    <p className="text-amber-700 text-sm">
                        If you&apos;re already a Splitwise Pro subscriber and happy with it, there&apos;s no reason to switch. This guide is for people frustrated by the free tier limits or looking for alternatives with different trade-offs.

                    What to Look for in an Alternative
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on what users actually need, here are the key criteria:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Unlimited expenses</strong> — No daily caps or artificial restrictions</li>
                    <li><strong>No forced app downloads</strong> — Not everyone wants another app on their phone</li>
                    <li><strong>Receipt scanning / itemization</strong> — For splitting complex bills</li>
                    <li><strong>Settlement optimization</strong> — Minimize the number of payments needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Free tier that&apos;s actually usable</strong> — Not a 7-day trial disguised as &quot;free&quot;</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-currency support</strong> — Critical for international trips</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    No app will check every box, but these are the features that matter most.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-3">
                    1. PartyTab — Best for groups who don&apos;t want to download an app
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>What it is:</strong> Web-based expense splitter with no app download required. You create a tab, share the link, and everyone can join and log expenses from their browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Best for:</strong> Groups where not everyone wants to download yet another app. Also great for one-off trips where you don&apos;t need a permanent account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free tier with unlimited expenses. Pro ($4.99/month) adds AI receipt scanning (15/month) and automated payment reminders.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>No app download needed—works in any browser</li>
                    <li>Unlimited expenses on free tier</li>
                    <li>AI-powered receipt scanning with item-level claiming (Pro)</li>
                    <li>Settlement optimization (fewest possible payments)</li>
                    <li>Clean, modern interface</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>No native mobile app (web-only for now)</li>
                    <li>Receipt scanning limited to 15/month on Pro tier</li>
                    <li>No multi-currency support yet</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Verdict:</strong> Best if your group hates downloading apps. The &quot;send a link, everyone joins&quot; flow is uniquely frictionless. Receipt scanning quality is excellent (powered by Claude AI), but it&apos;s Pro-only.
                </p>

                    2. Tricount — Best fully-free option
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>What it is:</strong> Long-standing expense splitter that recently made their entire product free (they deprecated their Premium plan).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Best for:</strong> Groups who want zero cost and don&apos;t need advanced features like receipt scanning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free (permanently—they removed paid tiers).
                </p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>100% free with no artificial limits</li>

                <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>No receipt scanning</li>
                    <li>No itemized splitting (can&apos;t claim individual items from a bill)</li>
                    <li>Requires app download (no web version)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Verdict:</strong> If you want zero cost and don&apos;t need receipt scanning or itemization, Tricount is rock-solid. The fact that they went fully free is a strong signal of sustainability.

                <p>

                </p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

                <p>
                    <strong>Verdict:</strong> Great cross-platform coverage and the $11/year premium is affordable. But the UX lags behind more modern alternatives.

                <p>
                    <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free and open source (MIT license). Self-hosting requires your own server/infrastructure.

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>Smaller community than Splitwise or Tricount</li>

                    6. Splitser — Best for large groups
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>What it is:</strong> Established expense splitter (founded 2005) with a focus on large groups and international use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Best for:</strong> Groups larger than 10 people, especially international groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free with ads. Premium removes ads and adds priority support.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>Handles groups up to 150 members</li>
                    <li>150+ currencies with real-time exchange rates</li>
                    <li>Can import from Splitwise</li>
                    <li>Battle-tested (5M users over 20+ years)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>Less well-known outside of the Netherlands</li>
                    <li>UI not as modern as newer competitors</li>
                    <li>No receipt scanning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Verdict:</strong> If you&apos;re managing a large group (think class trip, big reunion, corporate retreat), Splitser can handle the scale. But the interface shows its age.

                <p>
                    <strong>What it is:</strong> Ultra-simple expense splitter with zero registration and zero features beyond the basics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Best for:</strong> A single dinner or weekend where you just need to track who paid what and settle up once.

                <p>
                    <strong>Verdict:</strong> Like a shared spreadsheet but prettier. Good for splitting a single dinner check, not for a week-long trip. If you need any features beyond &quot;who paid what,&quot; look elsewhere.

                        <strong>If you&apos;re tech-savvy and privacy-conscious</strong> → Spliit. Open source, self-hostable, feature-rich.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>If you need cross-platform native apps</strong> → Settle Up or Splid. Both have solid mobile apps and web versions.

                    <li>
                        <strong>If you&apos;re managing a large international group</strong> → Splitser. Handles 150 people and 150 currencies without breaking a sweat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>If you just need to split one dinner</strong> → Kittysplit. Zero friction, zero features, zero cost.

                <p>
                    The common thread? All 7 offer unlimited expenses—the feature Splitwise took away. Whether you want advanced features, multi-currency support, or just basic expense tracking, you have options that won&apos;t hit you with artificial daily limits.
                </p>

                    <p className="text-amber-700 text-sm">
                        Most of these apps let you export your data. If you&apos;re leaving Splitwise, check if the new app supports importing from Splitwise (Settle Up, Splitser, and some others do). It&apos;ll save you from manually re-entering old balances.
